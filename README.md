# FlowSpectrum
This is the source code of FlowSpectrum.

## File

Decomposer_semiAE.py is used to build the neural network structure based on semi-supervised AutoEncoder.

Decomposer_training.py is used for continuous training of the decomposer.

FlowSpectrum.py includes the FlowSpectrum class.

FlowSpectrum_AE_Test.py is used to test the detection result using neural network structures as decomposer.

FlowSpectrum_ML_Test.py is used to test the detection result using traditional dimensionality reduction methods as decomposer.

KDD_preprocess.py is used for preprocessing of the dataset.
